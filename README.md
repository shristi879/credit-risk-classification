# credit-risk-classification

#Before You Begin

Create a new repository for this project called credit-risk-classification. Do not add this homework to an existing repository.

Clone the new repository to your computer.

Inside your credit-risk-classification repository, create a folder titled "Credit_Risk."

Inside the "Credit_Risk" folder, add the credit_risk_classification.ipynb and lending_data.csv files found in the "Starter_Code.zip" file.

Push your changes to GitHub.

#Split the Data into Training and Testing Set:

Open the starter code notebook and use it to complete the following steps:

Read the lending_data.csv data from the Resources folder into a Pandas DataFrame.

Create the labels set (y) from the “loan_status” column, and then create the features (X) DataFrame from the remaining columns.
Split the data into training and testing datasets by using train_test_split.

Split the data into training and testing datasets by using train_test_split.

#Two diffeent Logistic Regression models were created by using the original data set and randomly over resampled data set.Their results -which was gathered with scikit-learn library- were compared.
#In this analysis, we first split our data to traning and test sets. Then, define our dependent and independent variables. Next, we create logistic regression model and fit our original data to this model. Trained model is used to make predictions. Lastly, we evaluate the model`s performance.
